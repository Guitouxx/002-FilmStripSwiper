This repo includes a code extract of the prototype "WalkingFilm Strip Swiper" at [https://playgl.xyz/2](https://playgl.xyz/2).

Here, I wanted to emulate a rolling film strip effect, based on this [tweet](https://x.com/nuevo_tokyo/status/1709450289164816677) by Nuevo Tokyo for the VWFNDR camera.

All prototypes that comes from playgl experiments will be shipped with:
- Threejs  
- Sveltekit  
- Tailwindcss

## Dev


To run:

```sh
# clone repo
git clone https://github.com/Guitouxx/002-FilmStripSwiper.git

# install deps
yarn

# run local host
yarn dev
```

Now open `localhost:3000` to test. Use `yarn run build` to build everything.
